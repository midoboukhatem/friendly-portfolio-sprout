          Hello, Trailblazers & Problem-Solvers!
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4 dark:text-white">
          Yes, I'm calling you that for a reason! Like you, I thrive on solving challenges and making business processes more efficient.
          My career has taken me across Russia, the U.S., France, and Morocco, where I've gained hands-on experience in CRM, marketing, 
          business analysis, commerce, and data-driven decision-making.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-4 dark:text-white">
          I began my journey as a CRM & Marketing Analyst, where I analyzed customer behavior and engagement strategies to optimize marketing campaigns 
          and sales processes. Working in hospitality, technology, and consulting sectors, I developed a deep understanding of how data can drive business success. 
          Over time, I realized that automation, process optimization, and structured data management could transform businesses, leading me to Salesforce.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-0 dark:text-white">
          Since then, I've earned multiple Salesforce certifications, worked on CRM optimization, business process automation, and data analysis, 
          and helped teams improve cross-functional collaboration through data-driven insights. Whether it's automating workflows, 
          streamlining sales and marketing efforts, or leveraging data for smarter decision-making, I'm passionate about creating scalable, efficient solutions.
        </p>
